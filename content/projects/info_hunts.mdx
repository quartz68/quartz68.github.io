Information hunts are fun and really helped me go deeper into the topics we were learning in IST110.

I enjoyed the process of researching and presenting the information. It is a great way to learn more about different topics, see other people's perspectives, and share my own.

## L01: Virtual Information Treasure Hunt

This was also the first group project I did in IST110. I worked with Gabi and Alex, and we had a great time researching and presenting the information.

I focused mainly on the paper *Information overload for (bounded) rational agents* by Pothos et al. It takes a theoretical approach, examining how bounded agents that attempt to always apply rational Bayesian reasoning can be overwhelmed by the amount of information they have to process. It is particularly interesting to me to learn that when individuals simplify their reasoning, "dysfunctional disagreement" can occur, where two rational individuals cannot converge on a conclusion.
## L02: Binary Representation

To be frank, I was already pretty familiar with binary representation of stuff when doing this assignment. Being familiar with binary and hex representations helps when you are working at the low level like system programming, and matters even more at the bare metal level, like when you are programming microcontrollers or working with assembly language.

## L05: Choose the Best OS

Choosing the OS is a very basic problem when doing IT administration for an organization. It is important to consider the needs of the organization and the users, as well as the cost and the support available for the OS. The best OS is the one that best fits the needs of the organization and the users.

## L07: CODIS Cold Case

</object>

This was a very interesting project. I learned a lot about how genetic information is used in crime case investications. CODIS is a very powerful tool that can help solve cold cases and bring justice to the victims and their families, and it is one of the better uses of genetic information. The same can't be said for some other uses of genetic information, which can become a source of discrimination, or a violation of privacy and human rights.

## L07: Music Genome Project

<object data="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l07_music_genome_project.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" className="rounded-lg">
    <embed src="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l07_music_genome_project.pdf" />
</object>

I've heard of Pandora before but never used it, nor did I know about the Music Genome Project. It is a very interesting project that uses a lot of data and algorithms to recommend music to users. It is a great example of how data can be used to provide value to users, and how algorithms can be used to make sense of data. The hand curation of the music genome is also very interesting, and I think it is a great way to provide a human touch to the recommendation system.

## l08: OSINT

<object data="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l08_osint.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" className="rounded-lg">
    <embed src="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l08_osint.pdf" />
</object>

This was a group project that and I worked on with Regina and Mpho. I focused on social media OSINT, while Regina focused on websites and blogs, and Mpho focused on academic publications. It was a great experience to work with them and learn about the different sources of OSINT.

## L11: What do Companies Know About You?

<object data="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l11_what_do_companies_know_about_you.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" className="rounded-lg">
    <embed src="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l11_what_do_companies_know_about_you.pdf" />
</object>

The results were inconclusive for me, probably because I was new to the US and didn't have much of a digital footprint here yet. It is a bit alarming to think about how much information companies have about you, and how they can use that information to influence your behavior.

## L12: Cybercrime

<object data="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l12_cybercrime.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" className="rounded-lg">
    <embed src="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l12_cybercrime.pdf" />
</object>

This was the biggest project in this category. I think I made the argument "punishment for cybercrimes should focus on rehabilitation" pretty well. I also didn't expect to learn that there was actually a testimony from a hacker group in front of the US Senate in 1998. It was interesting to watch.

## L13: Enterprise Technology Integration

<object data="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l13_enterprise_technology_integration.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" className="rounded-lg">
    <embed src="/pdfs/projects/ist110/l13_enterprise_technology_integration.pdf" />
</object>

This project was about looking into three enterprises in different industries: supply chain and retail, manufacturing, and financial services, and how they use technology.
