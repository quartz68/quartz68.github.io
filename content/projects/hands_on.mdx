These hands-on activities were really simple and fun.

## L04: Hardware Dissection Lab

I actually followed ifixit guides for repairing my own devices before, and I think they are very helpful. Once I tried replacing swollen batteries for my 1st generation Surface Book (which was notoriously difficult to repair) with their guide. They are also an ally in the "rights to repair" movement, which I support.

## L06: Python Programming

I have been using Python for a while now, and I think it is a great language for beginners. Its syntax is very close to those of natural languages, and has a great ecosystem of libraries that can help you do a lot of things in different fields. I've always treated it as a glue.

## L07: SQL

I was also already familiar with SQL. This is the universal language for database query and manipulation.

## L09: HTML

</object>

Almost in no cases do I try to write pure HTML by hand. For frontend development, I usually use frameworks like React.

## L09: JavaScript

JavaScript is not a particularly well-designed language, but it is the standard for web development, and it can be performant.
