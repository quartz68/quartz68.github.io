This semester, over the course of IST110, I have created a few infographics.

Infographics are a great tool to help visualize and explain the concepts we learned in the course, and I have found the process of creating them enjoyable.

## Computational Problem Solving

This infographic was created by myself, using Adobe Express.

It explains the process of computational problem solving, which involves decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design and abstraction. I made it so that it looks like you are climbing up the stairs and collecting the methods as you go.

## Malware

This infographic was created by my group, again using Adobe Express. Shout out to Dan and Tovi for the great research and design!

It is very informative and explains the different types of malware and their statistics, how they work, and how to protect yourself from them. I contributed to the research in malware trends and prevention and am proud of the final product.
