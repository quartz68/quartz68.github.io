          üòâ Hi there! I&apos;m Steven Wang, or if you prefer my Chinese name, ÁéãÊ¢ìËêå (Zimeng Wang). Welcome to my personal corner of the web! Currently this site is serving as my final project portfolio for the IST110 course.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I&apos;m an undergraduate student majoring in Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University, and I also work as a software developer at a startup company based in central Pennsylvania. It&apos;s a busy but rewarding mix of learning, creating and growing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I believe in a future where information and intelligence are abundant and accessible. I&apos;m passionate about technology as a driving force for change in the world. Software development, data science, and artificial intelligence are my playgrounds.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I love exploring ideas and stories. I am drawn to science fiction (especially the New Wave and Cyberpunk ones), as well as history and philosophy. For balance, I unwind with video games, movies, and music. When I see beauty in life, I like to capture it through my camera lens.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I value connecting and resonating with people. I‚Äôm trying hard to overcome the challenges of expressing myself confidently and showing my appreciation of other people in English. If you want to chat, feel free to reach out to me, I&apos;d love to hear from you!
